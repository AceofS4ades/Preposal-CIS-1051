# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Interactive Music Visualizer - (PulsePalette?, TempoTrek, )

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive audio/music visualizer, which will let users select their own audio file and tweak the parameters of the visualizer to get a different look, such as intensity, colour, and shape.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will analyze audio input from users, whether from music files or live microphone input, and generate visualizations that respond to the rhythm, melody, and dynamics of the music. Features of the visualizer will include a variety of visualization modes such as spectrograms, waveform displays, particle effects, and animated graphics that synchronize with the music. Users will have the ability to customize the visualizations, adjust parameters such as color schemes, motion effects, and intensity levels, and switch between different visualization modes on the fly. The libraries I will potentially use include pygame, matplotlibrary, numpy, random, and Librosa. The goal is to create an immersive and responsive program for users.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A, if applicable 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project would be, visuaizer displays properly, can play any songs / sound (hopefully user uploaded but not necesarily)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A great outcome for the project would be an app or site users can interact with, upload their own songs, play the visualizer and change the parameters (in real time) and the changes take effect on the visualizer. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would hope to acomplish a web application that looks very visually appealing, allows users to add custom sounds, visualzier works fluidly, code does not break, and it works rapidly and is not cumbersome. I would need to learn data visualization, real-time processing, and user interface design.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The skills I will need to aquire are going to be finding the right python libraries for the project such as Librosa or MatPlot, as well as figuring out how to get user to upload audio file, read the audio levels from an audio file and output that to a visual representation.
